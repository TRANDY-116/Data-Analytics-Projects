Exploring and analyzing the TMBD Movies dataset to uncover trends, patterns, and insights. From initial data investigation to engineering data-driven solutions, this project showcases my journey in the world of data analytics. Dive into the world of movies and data with me

Here is a README.md file for that movie dataset exploratory analysis Jupyter notebook:

# Movie Dataset Exploratory Analysis

This project analyzes a movie dataset to gain insights into patterns and trends in terms of budget, revenue, popularity and success of movies. The data contains details on over 7,000 movies released between 1916 and 2016.

## Description

The Jupyter notebook investigates the following key areas of the movie dataset:

- Data Cleaning: Handling missing values and formatting
- Genre Analysis: Exploring most popular movie genres overall and by decade 
- Runtime Analysis: Analyzing average movie runtime statistics
- Budget & Revenue Analysis: Key metrics on movie financial performance 
- Movie Rating & Popularity Analysis: Investigating rating distribution and top rated movies  

For each section a set of visual plots are provided to illustrate findings and summary statistics are calculated on relevant attributes like budget, revenue and ratings.

The analysis aims to find interesting insights on movies that performed well versus those that lost money, uncover trends in popular genres and runtimes, and see how lucrative movie making has been over the last century.

## Requirements

The code was written in Python 3, mainly using Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib.

To run locally, you'll need:

- Python 
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Usage 

The entirety of the analysis is contained in the Jupyter notebook *Investigate_a_Dataset.ipynb*. 

To view the notebook non-interactively, you can use [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/).

To run:

1. Download the dataset `movie_metadata.csv`
2. Launch Jupyter notebook
3. Run each cell sequentially to step through the analysis 

The notebook is heavily commented and intended to be run end-to-end as a self-contained data analysis report. Plots and findings are displayed inline alongside key cells.
